RELEASE NOTES FOR Trim Galore v0.4.dev (08 April 2016)
----------------------------------------------------

Replaced 'zcat' with 'gunzip -c' so that older versions of Mac OSX do not append a .Z to the
end of the file and subsequently fail because the file is not present. Dah...

Added option '--max_n COUNT' to remove all reads (or read pairs) exceeding this limit of tolerated
Ns. In a paired-end setting it is sufficient if one read exceeds this limit. Reads (or read pairs)
are removed altogether and are not further trimmed or written to the unpaired output. 

Fixed a typo in adapter auto-detection warning message.


RELEASE NOTES FOR Trim Galore v0.4.1 (12 Nov 2015)
--------------------------------------------------
Changes for small RNA-libraries:

Changed the Illumina small RNA sequence used for auto-detection to 'TGGAATTCTCGG' (from formerly
'ATGGAATTCTCG'). The reason for this is that smallRNA libraries have ssRNA adapters ligated to their
-OH end, a signature of dicer cleavage, so there is no A-tailing involved. Thanks to Q. Gouil for 
bringing this to our attention.

Changed the length cutoff for sequences to 16bp (down from 20bp) for smallRNA libraries before
sequences get removed entirely. This is because some 20-23bp long smallRNAs species that had removed
T, TG, or TGG etc. might just about pass the 20bp cutoff.

Added a small description to the --help message for users of the NuGEN Ovation RRBS kit as to *NOT*
use the --rrbs option (see --help).



RELEASE NOTES FOR Trim Galore v0.4.0 (07 May 2015)
--------------------------------------------------

Unless instructed otherwise Trim Galore will now attempt to auto-detect the adapter which
had been used for library construction (choosing from the Illumina universal, Nextera
transposase and Illumina small RNA adapters). For this the first 1 million sequences of
the first file specified are analysed. If no adapter can be detected within the first
1 million sequences Trim Galore defaults to --illumina. The auto-detection behaviour can
be overruled by specifying an adapter sequence or using --illumina, --nextera or --small_rna.

Added the new options '--illumina', '--nextera' and '--small_rna' to use different default sequences
for trimming (instead of -a):

    Illumina:	AGATCGGAAGAGC
    Small RNA:	ATGGAATTCTCG
    Nextera:	CTGTCTCTTATA


Added a sanity check to the start of a Trim Galore run to see if the (first) FastQ file in
question does contain information at all or appears to be in SOLiD colorspace format, and bails
if either is true. Trim Galore does not support colorspace trimming, but users wishing to do 
this are kindly referred to using Cutadapt as a standalone program.

Added a new option '--path_to_cutadapt /path/to/cudapt'. Unless this option is specified it is
assumed that Cutadapt is in the PATH (equivalent to '--path_to_cutadapt cutadapt'). Also added
a test to see if Cutadapt seems to be working before the actual trimming is launched.

Fixed an open command for a certain type of RRBS processing (was open() instead of open3().
